# Getting Started
For this challenge, the goal is to demonstrate that cities closer to the equator tend to be hotter. 
To start, I generated 1,500 random latitude/longitude pairs and used them to create a list of cities. Then, I fetched weather data for those cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. Initially, I didn't realize the data was in Kelvin, so I added units = metric to my endpoint URL to convert the temperatures to Celsius. Before diving into pulling data for all the cities, I decided to first explore a single city to understand what I was working with. I used Minneapolis for this initial test, sending a GET request and JSONifying the result. 
Once I had a sense of the data, I began writing a for loop to retrieve information like latitude, longitude, maximum temperature, humidity, cloud coverage, wind speed, country, and date. I also used a try-except block to skip over any cities that caused errors.
After loading the data, I moved on to creating scatterplots. During this process, I ran into some interesting challenges. The first was realizing that the temperature data seemed strange—this is when I figured out I needed to convert the temperature to Celsius.
Another issue was when I compared my scatterplot to the example plot provided in the instructions. My data had a lot of negative temperature values, while the example didn’t. I soon discovered that the example plot used a fixed date of "2024-06-17," while my data was randomly pulled from different cities on different date. I also wanted the date in my plot to reflect the current day when the grader opens the notebook. I found a solution for that by using Python's datetime module to insert today's date, which will automatically update when the notebook is opened later. Here's the source I used:
"Getting Today's Date in YYYY-MM-DD in Python." Stack Overflow, 2015, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32490629/getting-todays-date-in-yyyy-mm-dd-in-python.
I still noticed an odd pattern in my temperature vs. latitude scatterplot. There was a cluster of negative temperatures in the 20-80 latitude range. Upon further investigation, I realized that cities in the northern latitudes, especially between 40-80, are experiencing winter right now. For example, Albany, NY is currently -10°C, which I verified against other sources. Based on this, I trust that the negative temperatures I’m seeing are accurate. 
Next, I created a linear regression function to analyze the relationship between latitude and temperature. The challenge with this was dynamically annotating the line equation on the plot. I initially set the equation’s position to (0,0), but it didn’t show up on the southern hemisphere plot because that point wasn’t on the graph. I adjusted the position based on the min values of both the x and y axes, placing the equation in the bottom-left corner of the graph.
# Observations About the Linear Relationship of Temperature and Latitude:
Looking at the northern hemisphere linear regression, I observed a moderately strong negative correlation: as you move north from the equator, the temperature tends to drop. The r² value of 0.79 tells me this relationship is a good model. The y-intercept of 35.68°C suggests that the temperature at the equator would be quite hot. The line's slope of -0.82 shows a significant decrease in temperature as you move north. I saw temperatures in the 60-80° latitude range dropping as low as -40°C, with one outlier at 80° N showing a temperature near 0°C.
For the southern hemisphere, I noticed a moderately weak positive correlation: temperatures near the equator tend to be warmer, but with an r² value of only 0.33, the relationship isn’t very strong. The data points are widely clustered around temperatures of 20-30°C and latitudes from -35° to 0°, with a noticeable dip into colder temperatures around latitudes of -35° to -50°. The majority of points are in the warmer temperature range.
Interestingly, more northern cities are experiencing colder temperatures than southern cities, which makes sense because the Northern Hemisphere is in its winter months. If I wanted to explore this further, I might analyze the percentage of northern vs. southern cities experiencing temperatures below 3°C, but I’m not diving that deep just yet.
Overall, the data supports the idea that latitude has a significant impact on temperature, with the Northern Hemisphere showing colder temperatures due to its winter season.
