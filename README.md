# Getting Started
For this challenge, the goal is to demonstrate that cities closer to the equator tend to be hotter. 
To start, I generated 1,500 random latitude/longitude pairs and used them to create a list of cities. Then, I fetched weather data for those cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. Initially, I didn't realize the data was in Kelvin, so I added units = metric to my endpoint URL to convert the temperatures to Celsius. Before diving into pulling data for all the cities, I decided to first explore a single city to understand what I was working with. I used Minneapolis for this initial test, sending a GET request and JSONifying the result. 
Once I had a sense of the data, I began writing a for loop to retrieve information like latitude, longitude, maximum temperature, humidity, cloud coverage, wind speed, country, and date. I also used a try-except block to skip over any cities that caused errors.
After loading the data, I moved on to creating scatterplots. During this process, I ran into some interesting challenges. The first was realizing that the temperature data seemed strange—this is when I figured out I needed to convert the temperature to Celsius.
Another issue was when I compared my scatterplot to the example plot provided in the instructions. My data had a lot of negative temperature values, while the example didn’t. I soon discovered that the example plot used a fixed date of "2024-06-17," while my data was randomly pulled from different cities on different date. I also wanted the date in my plot to reflect the current day when the grader opens the notebook. I found a solution for that by using Python's datetime module to insert today's date, which will automatically update when the notebook is opened later. Here's the source I used:
"Getting Today's Date in YYYY-MM-DD in Python." Stack Overflow, 2015, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32490629/getting-todays-date-in-yyyy-mm-dd-in-python.
I still noticed an odd pattern in my temperature vs. latitude scatterplot. There was a cluster of negative temperatures in the 20-80 latitude range. Upon further investigation, I realized that cities in the northern latitudes, especially between 40-80, are experiencing winter right now. For example, Albany, NY is currently -10°C, which I verified against other sources. Based on this, I trust that the negative temperatures I’m seeing are accurate. 
Next, I created a linear regression function to analyze the relationship between latitude and temperature. The challenge with this was dynamically annotating the line equation on the plot. I initially set the equation’s position to (0,0), but it didn’t show up on the southern hemisphere plot because that point wasn’t on the graph. I adjusted the position based on the min values of both the x and y axes, placing the equation in the bottom-left corner of the graph.
# Observations About the Linear Relationship of Temperature and Latitude:
Looking at the northern hemisphere linear regression, I observed a moderately strong negative correlation: as you move north from the equator, the temperature tends to drop. The r² value of 0.79 tells me this relationship is a good model. The y-intercept of 35.68°C suggests that the temperature at the equator would be quite hot. The line's slope of -0.82 shows a significant decrease in temperature as you move north. I saw temperatures in the 60-80° latitude range dropping as low as -40°C, with one outlier at 80° N showing a temperature near 0°C.
For the southern hemisphere, I noticed a moderately weak positive correlation: temperatures near the equator tend to be warmer, but with an r² value of only 0.33, the relationship isn’t very strong. The data points are widely clustered around temperatures of 20-30°C and latitudes from -35° to 0°, with a noticeable dip into colder temperatures around latitudes of -35° to -50°. The majority of points are in the warmer temperature range.
Interestingly, more northern cities are experiencing colder temperatures than southern cities, which makes sense because the Northern Hemisphere is in its winter months. If I wanted to explore this further, I might analyze the percentage of northern vs. southern cities experiencing temperatures below 3°C, but I’m not diving that deep just yet.
Overall, the data supports the idea that latitude has a significant impact on temperature, with the Northern Hemisphere showing colder temperatures due to its winter season. 
# Observations About the Linear Relationship of Humidity and Latitude:
This was an interesting correlation, and both relationships turned out to be significantly weak. Initially, I noticed that the northern hemisphere has a weak correlation with an r² value of 0.21. The rate of change is 0.57, suggesting a positive correlation, which would indicate that the farther up north you go, the more humidity you will experience. This was a fascinating observation for me. I live in the northern hemisphere, so I always assumed that humidity is much lower during the winter months, but this plot suggests otherwise. It’s a bit of a surprise that humidity might increase as you move north—perhaps it’s a snowy moment, and the northern regions are seeing an uptick in humidity. Snowstorms and cold weather can actually add moisture to the air, even if it feels dry.
You can see this trend more clearly in the latitude range 35–80, where the humidity levels rarely dip below 40%. It’s also interesting that at the equator, humidity levels vary quite a bit. Between latitudes 0°–30°, the range of humidity spans from 0% to 100%, showing that not all cities near the equator are experiencing the same level of humidity. So, even though we think of the equator as consistently humid, the data tells us there's a lot more variability.
For the southern hemisphere, the correlation is almost nonexistent, with an r² value of 0.02. This tells us that latitude doesn't seem to have much of an effect on humidity in this region, so I wouldn’t say there’s a clear pattern. Even though the line of best fit has a rate of change of 0.18, which suggests that closer proximity to the equator leads to more humidity, the r² value is so low that this model isn’t showing a strong relationship.
Overall, it's clear that humidity is influenced by factors other than latitude—weather systems, local geography, and seasonal conditions are likely playing much larger roles. It’s worth considering that these factors might be contributing to the weak correlations we’re seeing. Even though the data from the northern hemisphere shows a slight positive trend, I wouldn’t conclude that latitude alone is driving these changes in humidity.
# Observations About the Linear Relationship of Cloudiness and Latitude:
This correlation between latitude and cloudiness is significantly weak, with r^2 values of 0.02 for the north and 0.01 for the south, but with some interesting observations. For the north, we see interesting clustering with the clouds. It looks like mostly that either you are 0 with clouds or 100 with clouds. There is not a lot of dispersion of points in the center between. We see a lot of cloud points across the top (100) and bottom (0) across all latitude. The south is a bit more spread out with some clustering in the 100 cloudiness between latitude -20 and 0. Overall, we cannot make any final distinctions between latitude and cloudiness.
